PyMISES Implementation Analysis
Overview
PyMISES is a Python implementation of the MISES (Multiple-blade Interacting Streamtube Euler Solver) originally developed by Mark Drela at MIT. It employs a coupled Euler/boundary-layer approach for analyzing airfoils and turbine cascades, using a streamline-based discretization solved via Newton's method.
Major Components and Issues
1. Euler Solver (euler.py)
Critical Issues:

Inconsistent handling of array shapes (2D vs. flattened) creates complexity and potential bugs
Simplified artificial dissipation model that may not adequately capture shocks
Hardcoded values in performance calculation methods (compute_cascade_performance, compute_forces)
Limited error handling for numerical issues such as division by zero or negative densities
Grid metrics computation doesn't handle corner cases properly

Recommendations:

Standardize array handling throughout the solver
Implement modern shock-capturing schemes (MUSCL, WENO, or matrix dissipation)
Replace hardcoded values with physically-based calculations
Add robust error handling with appropriate fallbacks
Improve grid metrics computation for irregular grids

2. Boundary Layer Solver (boundary_layer.py)
Critical Issues:

Inconsistent transition prediction criteria between implementation and tests
Test-specific logic embedded in production code (e.g., "decelerating flow test" special case)
Simple RK4 integration without adaptive step sizing for stability
Poor handling of leading edge region (xâ†’0) singularities
Complex branching logic for transitional flows
Simplified lag equation implementation for non-equilibrium effects

Recommendations:

Implement consistent transition prediction models
Remove test-specific code
Introduce adaptive step sizing for numerical integration
Develop specialized handling for leading edge regions
Simplify transitional flow logic
Enhance non-equilibrium turbulence modeling

3. Viscous-Inviscid Coupling (coupling.py)
Critical Issues:

Problematic upper/lower surface separation logic
Forward differences used instead of more accurate central differencing
Incomplete implementation of run_loose_coupling method
run_strong_coupling is just a placeholder
Simplified Jacobian (identity matrix) that doesn't represent coupling terms
Defensive coding with excessive try-except blocks
Reference to non-existent methods

Recommendations:

Improve surface separation logic for general airfoil shapes
Implement central differencing for displacement thickness derivatives
Complete the grid deformation for displacement effects
Properly implement strong coupling with full Jacobian terms

4. Grid Generation (grid.py)
Critical Issues:

Point redistribution can break grid topology
Simple Laplacian smoothing without orthogonality constraints
Stability issues in elliptic grid generation

Recommendations:

Maintain consistent grid topology during point redistribution

5. Boundary Conditions (wall.py)

Inconsistent derivative calculations at boundaries
Code duplication for tangent/normal vector calculations
Incomplete Jacobian contribution implementations

No special handling for geometric corners

Recommendations:

Standardize derivative calculations

6. Geometry Handling (geometry.py)
Critical Issues:

Insufficient error handling in coordinate interpolation
Outdated NACA airfoil formula
Potentially inaccurate curvature computation for coarse discretizations
Point redistribution may not preserve key geometric features
Simplified cascade geometry representation
Numerical sensitivity in normal vector calculations
Limited format support for geometry file I/O

Recommendations:

Improve upper/lower surface identification algorithms
Add robust error handling for coordinate operations
Update NACA airfoil formula with modern corrections
Enhance curvature computation for better accuracy
Ensure preservation of key geometric features during redistribution
Support more complex cascade geometries
Improve numerical robustness of vector calculations

7. Testing and Numerical Robustness
Critical Issues:

Limited iteration count in convergence tests
Numerous debug print statements in tests
Contradictory assertions in some tests
Limited coverage of edge cases
Validation focuses on residuals rather than conservation
Manual override of transition points instead of model validation
Missing performance and scaling tests
Use of simplified grids that may hide issues

Recommendations:

Increase iteration counts for meaningful convergence testing
Clean up test code and implement proper assertions
Fix contradictory test assertions
Add comprehensive test cases for edge conditions
Add conservation checks to validation
Properly test transition prediction capabilities
Implement performance and scaling tests
Use production-level grid resolution in tests

8. Aerodynamic Domain-Specific Issues
Critical Issues:

Simplified artificial dissipation compared to state-of-the-art
Integral boundary layer formulation limitations
Dated transition prediction models
Simplistic wake treatment
Inaccurate force calculation without far-field integration
Limited inflow/outflow handling for cascade flows
Constant specific heat ratio assumption
No support for multi-element airfoils

Recommendations:

Implement modern shock-capturing schemes
Consider more advanced boundary layer models for complex phenomena
Update transition prediction with modern correlations
Improve wake modeling, especially for trailing edge effects
Implement far-field force integration
Enhance cascade boundary condition treatment
