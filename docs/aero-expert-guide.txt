PyMISES Aerodynamic Expert Guide
1. Mathematical Foundation
1.1 Euler Equations
The core of PyMISES is based on the steady, two-dimensional Euler equations formulated in integral form:
Mass Conservation:
? ?q·n ds = 0
Momentum Conservation:
?(?(q·n)q + pn) ds = 0
Energy Conservation:
?(?(q·n)h) ds = 0
Where:
* ? is density
* q is velocity vector
* n is unit normal vector
* p is pressure
* h is total enthalpy
1.2 Streamline-Based Discretization
The unique aspect of PyMISES is the use of an intrinsic streamline grid where:
1. One set of coordinate lines corresponds to streamlines
2. There is no convection across the corresponding faces of conservation cells
3. Mass flux and stagnation enthalpy are constant along streamtubes
This leads to several advantages:
* Reduction from 4 to 2 unknowns per grid node
* No numerical diffusion of entropy or enthalpy across streamlines
* Faithful reproduction of analytic information propagation mechanisms
* Natural adaptation to the flow field
1.3 Artificial Dissipation
For transonic flows, artificial dissipation is implemented as a bulk viscosity-like term:
? = { 0,                    M < Mc
    { Cd(1-(Mc/M)²)/(2M²), M > Mc
Where:
* Mc is threshold Mach number (typically 0.9-0.95)
* Cd is dissipation coefficient (typically 0.5-1.0)
This approach provides:
* Stable shock capturing
* Prevention of expansion shocks
* Minimal numerical diffusion in subsonic regions
1.4 Integral Boundary Layer Equations
The viscous effects are modeled using integral boundary layer equations:
Momentum Integral Equation:
?(d?/dx) = (Cf/2) - (H+2-M²?)(?/U?)(dU?/dx)
Shape Parameter Equation:
?(dH*/dx) = 2CD/H* - Cf/2·(2H**/H* + 1 - H) - ?/U?·(dU?/dx)
Where:
* ? is momentum thickness
* ?* is displacement thickness
* H = ?*/? is shape parameter
* H* is kinetic energy shape parameter
* H** is density thickness shape parameter
* Cf is skin friction coefficient
* CD is dissipation coefficient
* Ue is edge velocity
* Me is edge Mach number
1.5 Closure Relations
1.5.1 Laminar Closure
For laminar flow, closure relations are based on the Falkner-Skan profile family:
H* = 1.515 + 0.076(Hk-4)²/Hk,  Hk < 4
H* = 1.515 + 0.040(Hk-4)²/Hk,  Hk > 4

Cf·Re? = -0.067 + 0.01977(7.4-Hk)²/(Hk-1)

2CD/H* = 0.207 + 0.00205(4-Hk)?·?, Hk < 4
2CD/H* = 0.207 - 0.003(Hk-4)², Hk > 4
Where Hk is the kinematic shape parameter.
1.5.2 Turbulent Closure
For turbulent flow:
Cf = 0.3e?¹·³³Hk/(log??(Re?))¹·????·³¹Hk · Fc
Where Fc is a compressibility correction.
The energy shape parameter is given by:
H* = (1.505 + 400/Re?) / Hk·(1 + (H?-H)²(0.04 + 0.007ln(Re?)/Hk))
The dissipation coefficient uses a lag-entrainment approach:
CD = Cf·Us² + CT(1-Us)
Where CT is a maximum shear stress coefficient that follows a lag equation to account for non-equilibrium effects:
? dCT/dx = KC(CT_EQ^(1/2) - CT^(1/2))
With KC = 5.6 as the lag constant and ? as the boundary layer thickness.
1.6 Transition Prediction
Based on Drela's modified Abu-Ghannam/Shaw transition criterion, transition is predicted using a hybrid approach combining the e? method with a bypass transition model:
1.6.1 Amplification Factor Method
The amplification factor n is governed by:
?(dn/dx) = f(H,Re?) + g(H,Re?)
Where:
* f(H,Re?) is the Orr-Sommerfeld-based TS wave growth rate
* g(H,Re?) is a bypass transition term that activates as Re? approaches a critical value
The g term is defined as:
g(H,Re?) = { 0             r < 0
           { A(3r² - 2r³)  0 < r < 1
           { A             r > 1

r = (1/B)((Re?/Re?s) - 1) + 1/2
Where:
* A = 0.10 (amplification rate constant)
* B = 0.30 (ramp width parameter)
* Re?s is the critical Reynolds number
1.6.2 Critical Reynolds Number
The critical Reynolds number is modified from the original Abu-Ghannam/Shaw formulation:
Re?s(H,ñcrit) = 155 + 89.0[0.25tanh(10/(H-1) - 5.5) + 1](ñcrit)^1.25
Where ñcrit is related to the turbulence level ? by:
?' = 2.7tanh(?/2.7)
ñcrit(?) = -8.43 - 2.4ln(?'/100)
This formulation addresses the ill-posedness of the original AGS criterion by:
1. Using H instead of ? to parameterize boundary layer instability
2. Adding a smooth transition from stability to instability
3. Accounting for viscous-inviscid interaction effects
1.6.3 Initial Turbulence Level
For transition modeling in varying edge velocity fields (e.g., turbine cascades), the amplification equation is modified to:
(dn?/dx) + (dlnue/dx) = (1/?)[f(H,Re?) + g(H,Re?)]
This accounts for the acceleration or deceleration of the external flow.
1.7 Viscous-Inviscid Coupling
Coupling is achieved through the displacement body concept:
* Inviscid flow sees a body displaced from the physical body by ?*
* Boundary layer equations are integrated into the global Newton system
* No separate iteration between solvers
This provides robust convergence even with separation bubbles present.
1.8 Inverse Design Framework
The inverse design capability includes:
Full Inverse:
* Pressure specified on entire airfoil
* Leading and trailing edge closure constraints
* Free parameters for well-posed problem
Mixed Inverse:
* Pressure specified on part of airfoil
* Geometry fixed elsewhere
* Continuity enforced at segment boundaries
* Additional free parameters for segment continuity
2. Numerical Solution Procedure
2.1 Newton Method
The coupled system of equations is solved using Newton's method:
[dF/dU]·?U = -F(U)
U^(v+1) = U^(v) + ?U
Where:
* F(U) is the residual vector
* U is the solution vector (?, ?n at each node)
* [dF/dU] is the Jacobian matrix
* v is the iteration index
2.2 Jacobian Structure
The Jacobian matrix has a block structure with:
* Four block diagonals (A, B, C, Z) for local variables
* Additional rows/columns for global variables and constraints
* Typical size ~4000-10000 equations
2.3 Linear System Solution
The linear system is solved using block Gaussian elimination:
* Forward sweep to eliminate Z and B blocks
* Backward sweep to eliminate modified C blocks
* Separate solution for global variables
* Back-substitution for local variables
2.4 Convergence Acceleration
Convergence is accelerated through:
* Proper under-relaxation in early iterations (r < 1)
* Full Newton steps (r = 1) once near solution
* Grid redistribution when needed
* Careful initialization strategies
