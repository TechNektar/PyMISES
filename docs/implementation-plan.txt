PyMISES Implementation Plan
1. Project Overview
PyMISES is a Python-based reimplementation of MIT's MISES (Multiple-blade Interacting Streamtube Euler Solver), originally developed by Mark Drela. This implementation aims to create a modular, well-structured, and extensible code that maintains the mathematical rigor of the original while leveraging modern software engineering practices.

3.     """Calculate combined amplification rate"""
4.     # TS wave component from Orr-Sommerfeld
5.     f_rate = self.calculate_ts_growth_rate(H, Re_theta)
6.     
7.     # Bypass transition component
8.     r = (1.0/self.B) * ((Re_theta/Re_theta_crit) - 1.0) + 0.5
9.     
10.     if r < 0:
11.         g_rate = 0.0
12.     elif r < 1:
13.         g_rate = self.A * (3.0*r*r - 2.0*r*r*r)
14.     else:

17.     return f_rate + g_rate
18. Critical Reynolds Number:

20.     """Calculate critical Reynolds number"""
21.     tau_prime = 2.7 * math.tanh(turbulence_level/2.7)
22.     n_crit = -8.43 - 2.4 * math.log(tau_prime/100.0)
23.     
24.     tanh_term = math.tanh(10.0/(H-1.0) - 5.5)
25.     Re_theta_crit = 155.0 + 89.0 * (0.25*tanh_term + 1.0) * (n_crit**1.25)

6. Transition Model Specifics
Based on Drela's paper on the Modified Abu-Ghannam/Shaw Transition Criterion, we need to implement several key components that address the ill-posedness of the original transition model:
6.1 Issues with Original AGS Model
The original Abu-Ghannam/Shaw (AGS) transition criterion defined in terms of Reynolds number R?, turbulence level ?, and the Thwaites parameter ? suffers from ill-posedness when implemented in a fully coupled viscous-inviscid solver. The key issues are:
1. The influence of transition on the upstream boundary layer creates a feedback loop
2. The transition region creates a "sink" effect that accelerates the upstream flow
3. This causes R? and R?S to diverge at the transition point, making the criterion unsatisfiable
6.2 Key Implementation Changes
Our implementation will incorporate Drela's improvements:
1. H-based Parameterization Instead of ?:
2. def critical_reynolds_from_H(self, H, turbulence_level):
3.     """Calculate critical Reynolds number based on H not lambda"""
4.     # Modified AGS criterion using H parameterization
5.     tau_prime = 2.7 * np.tanh(turbulence_level/2.7)
6.     n_crit = -8.43 - 2.4 * np.log(tau_prime/100.0)
7.     
8.     # H-based parameterization that works even in separation regions
9.     tanh_term = np.tanh(10.0/(H-1.0) - 5.5)
10.     Re_theta_crit = 155.0 + 89.0 * (0.25*tanh_term + 1.0) * (n_crit**1.25)
11.     
12.     return Re_theta_crit
13. Combined Growth Rate Approach:
14. def combined_growth_rate(self, H, Re_theta, Re_theta_crit):
15.     """Combine TS-wave and bypass growth rates"""
16.     # TS-wave amplification from Orr-Sommerfeld
17.     ts_rate = self.ts_amplification_rate(H, Re_theta)
18.     
19.     # Bypass transition component with cubic ramp function
20.     r = (1.0/self.B) * ((Re_theta/Re_theta_crit) - 1.0) + 0.5
21.     
22.     if r < 0:
23.         bypass_rate = 0.0
24.     elif r < 1:
25.         bypass_rate = self.A * (3.0*r**2 - 2.0*r**3)
26.     else:
27.         bypass_rate = self.A
28.         
29.     return ts_rate + bypass_rate
30. Edge Velocity Correction:
31. def update_n_factor(self, dx, theta, growth_rate, ue_ratio):
32.     """Update n-factor with edge velocity correction"""
33.     # Account for edge velocity changes
34.     dln_ue = np.log(ue_ratio)
35.     
36.     # Modified amplification equation (eq. 31 in Drela's paper)
37.     dn = (growth_rate * dx / theta) - dln_ue
38.     
39.     self.n_factor += dn
40.     return self.n_factor
41. Reynolds Stress Lag Modeling:
42. def update_reynolds_stress(self, dx, H, C_tau, C_tau_eq, delta):
43.     """Update Reynolds stress coefficient using lag equation"""
44.     # Lag equation for Reynolds stress coefficient (eq. 23 in Drela's paper)
45.     K_C = 5.6  # Lag constant
46.     
47.     # Square root form improves numerical behavior
48.     dC_tau = K_C * (np.sqrt(C_tau_eq) - np.sqrt(C_tau))
49.     
50.     # Scale by boundary layer thickness
51.     C_tau_new = C_tau + (dx * delta * dC_tau / C_tau)
52.     
53.     return C_tau_new
54. Initial Reynolds Stress at Transition:
55. def initial_C_tau(self, H, C_tau_eq):
56.     """Initialize Reynolds stress coefficient at transition onset"""
57.     # Correlation based on separation bubble data (eq. 24 in Drela's paper)
58.     factor = 3.24 * np.exp(-6.6/(H-1.0))
59.     
60.     # Limit to reasonable values
61.     factor = min(max(factor, 0.01), 5.0)
62.     
63.     return C_tau_eq * factor
6.3 Integration with Global Newton System
The transition model must be fully integrated into the Newton solver:
1. Differential Form for Newton Method:
o Use differential equation form for n-factor: ?(dn/dx) = f(H,R?) + g(H,R?)
o Include initial condition n(x?) = 0
o Add n-factor to global solution vector U
2. Jacobian Contributions:
o Add derivatives of amplification rates with respect to H and R?
o Include transition criterion in global Jacobian
o Ensure smooth behavior at transition onset
3. Coupling to Boundary Layer:
o Enable discontinuity capturing at transition

8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Several challenges must be addressed during implementation:
8.1 Technical Risks
1. Transition Model Stability:
o Risk: The transition model may exhibit numerical instabilities
o Mitigation: Implement H-based criterion instead of ?, use robust ramp functions, ensure proper coupling with inviscid flow
2. Newton Convergence Issues:
o Risk: Newton method may fail to converge for complex cases
o Mitigation: Implement adaptive under-relaxation, grid sequencing, robust initial guesses
3. Separation Handling:
o Risk: Boundary layer models may break down in strong separation
o Mitigation: Implement robust behavior in separation regions, validate against known separation cases
4. Shock Capturing:
o Risk: Shocks may cause numerical oscillations
o Mitigation: Refine artificial dissipation model, use grid adaptation near shocks
8.2 Schedule Risks
1. Complex Mathematical Implementation:
o Risk: Implementation of advanced models may take longer than expected
o Mitigation: Start with simplified versions, prioritize core functionality, incremental testing
2. Integration Challenges:
o Risk: Components may not work together as expected
o Mitigation: Clear interfaces, integration testing from early stages, modular design
3. Validation Time Requirements:
o Risk: Validation against experimental data may reveal issues requiring rework
o Mitigation: Continuous validation throughout development, prioritize critical test cases
8.3 Resource Risks
1. Computational Requirements:
o Risk: Performance may be inadequate for interactive use
o Mitigation: Profile early, optimize critical sections, consider GPU acceleration for compute-intensive parts
2. Documentation Burden:
o Risk: Complex mathematical models require extensive documentation
o Mitigation: Document as you go, use automated tools, prioritize user-facing documentation
9. Future Extensions
Once the core functionality is implemented, several extensions could enhance PyMISES:
1. Advanced Transition Models:

o Crossflow transition prediction
o Receptivity models
2. 3D Radial Equilibrium:
o Quasi-3D blade-to-blade analysis
o Streamline curvature in spanwise direction
o Hub-to-tip variations
3. Multi-Row Analysis:
o Multiple blade row interactions
o Wake mixing models
o Stage stacking capabilities
4. Optimization Framework:
o Multi-point design optimization
o Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis
o Machine learning surrogates
5. Advanced UI Features:
o Interactive design capabilities

o Integration with CAD systems
10. Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing PyMISES as a modern, modular reimplementation of the MISES solver. By following this structured approach with special attention to the transition model improvements described in Drela's paper, we can create a robust, accurate, and user-friendly tool for aerodynamic analysis and design.
The key to success will be maintaining mathematical rigor while adopting modern software engineering practices to ensure maintainability and extensibility. With a focus on validation and testing throughout the development process, PyMISES can become a valuable tool for both education and industrial applications in aerodynamic design.
