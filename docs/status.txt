## Overview
PyMISES is a Python-based reimplementation of MIT's MISES (Multiple-blade Interacting Streamtube Euler Solver), originally developed by Mark Drela. This implementation aims to create a modular, well-structured, and extensible code that maintains the mathematical rigor of the original while leveraging modern software engineering practices.
